AEC Hacking Competition is a famous Czech CTF with 15 web application security challenges. It used to work like this: If you solved at least 12 challenges, you were invited for the penetration tester interview.

Today, only around 28 people out of several hundred could solve all the challenges. Many ethical hackers were stuck on some levels, maybe because the instructions were not clear or outdated.

The CTF is from ~2018, and the authors haven't updated any of the challenges since. We could do better, especially for new people starting in the penetration testing field. I was the sixth person who solved all the challenges, and I received an e-mail recently from someone stuck on the first level asking for advice.

So, after many years, I finally decided to try to solve them again and describe my steps. I did this mainly to help beginners see that it's easy if they think like ethical hackers and have the correct mindset and necessary skills. I would also like to see new levels that reflect the current application security state and the OWASP Top 10.
