tl;dr: I created "CTF" style challenge for our **[OWASP Czech Chapter Virtual Meeting](https://www.meetup.com/owasp-czech-republic-meetup-group/events/274616231/)**. The goal was to write an XSS worm and score points by infecting 1k virtual users. You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/vavkamil/XSSworm.dev) and read the details in this post.
