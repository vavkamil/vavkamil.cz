## About

This repository contains the full source code and content for **vavkamil.cz**, my personal website and long-running security blog.

I write mostly about:

- Offensive web application security
- Bug bounty hunting & responsible disclosure
- Vulnerability research & real-world exploitation
- Supply-chain attacks, XSS, SSRF, logic bugs, and weird edge cases
- Write-ups of research, incidents, and CTFs
- Public talks & conference presentations

The site has been online in various forms for years and is intentionally kept **simple, static, and transparent**.

- **GitHub Pages** — hosting & deployment
- **Jekyll** — static site generator
