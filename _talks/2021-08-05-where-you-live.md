_An introduction into the KARMA attack, exploiting the behavior of some Wi-Fi devices, where vulnerable clients broadcast a "preferred network list" (PNL), which contains the SSIDs of access points to which they have previously connected. We will revisit the old technique, current defenses applied by vendors and build a custom access point using Raspberry Pi & Python._
