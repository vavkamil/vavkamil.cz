_Novel attack vector affecting WordPress websites. This talk will focus on the research from the beginning, explaining the motivation and exploration phase. A new scanner tool will be released, along with the Docker container for local testing. Lastly, you will get a chance to see the redacted results from the bug bounty hunting, recon process, and struggle with triage of the reports. TBU, currently still a 0day :)_
