_Most of the security-oriented people already know about the risks of WPE/WPA/WPA2 attacks and how to crack (in)secured Wi-Fi passwords, stuff we won't talk about. Instead, this talk will be focused on the JavaScript client-side attacks. XSS is overrated and CSRF is dead (SameSite cookie), but malicious actors are infecting hundreds of thousands of SOHO routers and turning them into powerful botnets almost daily. How hard is getting a foothold into the internal network with just a few JavaScript lines and why nobody is talking about it?_
