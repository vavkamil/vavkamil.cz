Hi there,

My name is Kamil, I'm an ethical hacker living in Brno, Czech republic. Currently working as Application Security Engineer.

I’m interested in offensive security, bug bounty, and web application penetration testing.

White hat probably since ~15yo, when I first learned about XSS & SQLi. Since then, reported many security vulnerabilities to top companies all around the world.

I used to write code in Perl a lot, but have been learning Python for a while. You can check my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/vavkamil){:target="_blank"} or follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vavkamil){:target="_blank"}.

Regarding [bug bounty]({{ site.baseurl }}/bug-bounty), I’m on both Bugcrowd (started in 2015) and HackerOne and I do a lot of responsible disclosure as well.

Lastly, sometimes I do [public talks]({{ site.baseurl }}/talks) and courses about ethical hacking (I'm also an OWASP Czech Chapter Leader). If you wanna reach me, check the [contact]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact) page.
