Hi there, my name is Kamil Vavra.

I’m an independent offensive security expert with **19+ years of hands-on ethical hacking experience**, specializing in offensive web application security.

White-hat hacker based in Brno, Czechia, currently working as a Senior Application Security Engineer. My work focuses on deep, manual web application testing, vulnerability research, and helping product teams secure real-world production systems.

I have been involved in offensive security since my early teens, when I first learned about XSS and SQL injection. Since then, I’ve discovered and responsibly reported thousands of security vulnerabilities to leading companies worldwide, helping protect products used by millions of people.

My main interests include offensive security, [bug bounty]({{ site.baseurl }}/bug-bounty) hunting, and web application security. I do a lot of security research, publish [blog]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog) posts, and regularly engage in responsible disclosure.

I enjoy sharing knowledge through public [talks]({{ site.baseurl }}/talks) on security conferences, and I’m also an OWASP Czech Chapter Leader. Occasionally, I write code. You can find my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/vavkamil){:target="_blank"} or add me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/vavkamil){:target="_blank"}.
